          <h1>Case Study: Spectral Overlay Tool</h1>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p><a href="https://www.biosearchtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biosearch Technologies</a> approached me to redesign and redevelop their spectral overlay tool in 2014. During this time Adobe Flash had already begun its decline in favor of HTML5 APIs, and the company recognized that the eventual drop in support for Flash would mean they would need to port the application to use HTML5 APIs.</p>
          <p>They also had plans to launch the <a href="http://qpcrdesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qPCR Design Lab</a>, a microsite that offered various resources and tools about quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeted to both new and experienced users. The spectral overlay tool would be one of the main tools to be featured on the site.</p>
          <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>I worked as a web developer consultant, responsible for the design of the user interface and flow as well as the programming of the application. Biosearch Technologies’s marketing team would define the high-level feature requirements, and the research team would give me the data used for the data visualizations. Once I created a build, I would need to coordinate with <a href="https://www.thespider.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spider</a>, a design agency Biosearch Technologies hired for creating the qPCR Design Lab. They would then deploy the application to the site.</p>
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>The first design was wireframed and wireflowed by both me and the marketing team. This design supported both desktop and mobile devices. We then quickly iterated through several live builds of the application until we settled on the finalized layout.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>In 2015, Biosearch Technologies was acquired by <a href="https://www.lgcgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LGC</a>. Because of this they reapproached me to perform some design changes that followed their new branding guidelines.</p>
          <p>In 2019 the company reapproached me again, as they wanted to redesign both the user interface and flow of the application. This time the design process was handled by <a href="https://www.columnfivemedia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Column Five</a>, and due to time constraints the design would only support desktop, pushing mobile device support for later.</p>
          <h2>Development</h2>
          <h3>User Interface</h3>
          <p>Because of my previous experience with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery</a>, I decided to use them as I was most comfortable with them. Initially I designed the layout using Bootstrap’s grid system to make iterating through the initial layout tests as fast as possible. Later on we realized it was important to maximize the amount of space the data visualizations took, especially on mobile devices. This wouldn’t work with the default dimensions defined by Bootstrap’s grids, so in order to have finer control I had to replace the grid system code with a custom layout built with CSS media queries.</p>
          <p>After looking at a few different data visualization libraries, I ended up choosing <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Charts</a> because of its support for area charts, simplicity, clear documentation, and popularity.</p>
          <p>In 2019, we considered porting the whole application over to a new library like <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js</a>. But since the application was still working fine and we had a tighter schedule, I decided to try to mostly maintain the technology stack and just update Bootstrap from version 3 to 4 as well as update jQuery and Google Charts to their latest versions. Some performance updates in chart drawing and data handling were done during this time as well.</p>
          <h3>Data Management</h3>
          <p>Biosearch Technology’s research team provided me with a <a href="https://products.office.com/excel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Excel</a> spreadsheet of data. In order to use this data with the application, I wrote a command line data conversion tool in <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> to convert the spreadsheet into JSON. In 2019, I ported this conversion tool to JavaScript and <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>.</p>
          <h3>Tooling</h3>
          <p>As I wanted to try out some new things in my workflow, I took the opportunity to use <a href="https://yeoman.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeoman</a> for the first time. This introduced me to <a href="https://gruntjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grunt</a> which increased my productivity significantly by handling the development server, handling auto-refresh in response to codebase updates, compiling <a href="https://sass-lang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sass</a> to CSS, linting my JavaScript with <a href="https://jshint.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSHint</a>, running unit tests, and handling production builds.</p>
          <p>In 2019, I replaced the Yeoman setup in favor of my own custom <a href="https://webpack.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpack</a> configuration.</p>
          <h2>Release & Reception</h2>
          <p>The spectral overlay tool first went live alongside qPCR Design Lab on October 23, 2014. The microsite was rewarded <a href="http://www.genengnews.com/best-of-the-web/qpcr-design-lab/2933/?kwrd=biosearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best of Web in Genetic Engineering News, vol. 35, no. 4.</a></p>
          <p>Later the qPCR Design Lab was shut down, but the tool was moved to the main Biosearch Technologies website.
