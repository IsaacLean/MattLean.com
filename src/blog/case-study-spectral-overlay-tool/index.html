          <h1>Case Study: Spectral Overlay Tool</h1>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>Biosearch Technologies approached me to redesign and redevelop their spectral overlay tool in 2014. During this time Adobe Flash had already begun its decline in favor of HTML5 APIs, and the company recognized that the eventual drop in support for Flash would mean they would need to port the application to use HTML5 APIs.</p>
          <p>They also had plans to launch the qPCR Design Lab, a microsite that offered various resources and tools about quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeted to both new and experienced users. The spectral overlay tool would be one of the main tools to be featured on the site.</p>
          <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>I worked as a web developer consultant, responsible for the design of the user interface and flow as well as the programming of the application. Biosearch Technologies’s marketing team would define the high-level feature requirements, and the research team would give me the data used for the data visualizations. Once I created a build, I would need to coordinate with The Spider, a design agency Biosearch Technologies hired for creating the qPCR Design Lab. They would then deploy the application to the site.</p>
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>The first design was wireframed and wireflowed by both me and the marketing team. This design supported both desktop and mobile devices. We then quickly iterated through several live builds of the application until we settled on the finalized layout.</p>
          <p>In 2015, Biosearch Technologies was acquired by LGC. Because of this they reapproached me to perform some design changes that followed their new branding guidelines.</p>
          <p>In 2019 the company reapproached me again, as they wanted to redesign both the user interface and flow of the application. This time the design process was handled by Column Five, and due to time constraints the design would only support desktop, pushing mobile device support for later.</p>
